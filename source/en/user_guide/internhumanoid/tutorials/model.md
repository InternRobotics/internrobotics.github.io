# Model
## Model Structure
We provide a modular model structure that consists of the following components:
- **VLM Backbone**: A vision-language model backbone that processes visual and language inputs.
- **Action Head**: A head that generates actions based on the processed features from the preceding layers.
- **PolicyModel**: A policy model that aggregates the above modules and drives the robot to perform tasks.

## VLM Backbone

## Action Head

## Policy Model
You need to implement a policy model to drive the robot.
