![track-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Track_1-Manipulation-blueviolet)


Welcome to the **IROS 2025 Challenge of Multimodal Robot Learning in InternUtopia and Real World**!
InternManip provides the **official baseline and evaluation toolkit** for **Track: Vision-Language Manipulation in Open Tabletop Environments**, featured at the *[IROS 2025 Workshop](https://internrobotics.shlab.org.cn/workshop/2025/)*.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

In this challenge, participants will develop end-to-end policies that fuse vision and language to control robots in simulated physics-based environment.
Models are trained using the **InternManip** framework and **GenManip** dataset, and evaluated in a closed-loop benchmark on unseen private scenes.

This repository serves as the **starter kit and evaluation toolkit**—you can use it to:
- Implement your own policy models
- Train them on GenManip public data
- Submit them via Docker for final evaluation
